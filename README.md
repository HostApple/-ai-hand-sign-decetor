idk man i just did it as a late night project

you need to put the file into a folder then open command prompt in the folder's location and then paste this :









**pip uninstall mediapipe -y**

**pip uninstall mediapipe-silicon -y**

**pip cache purge**


it will create a virtual enviornment because idk why but it needs the exact version of python and mediapipe ( ts actually pmo 🙏😭)
