idk man i just did it as a late night project

you need to put the file into a folder then open command prompt in the folder's location and then paste this :

**Pinch (thumb+index) → scroll (vertical scrolling based on finger movement)

Click (index+middle) → instant click (no hold)

YouTube still requires 5-second hold

Two-hand gesture still requires 10-second hold

Five fingers → smooth mouse movement**






**
# py -3.10 -m venv handenv
# handenv\Scripts\activate
# pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy
# python ai_hand_control_final.py
**


it will create a virtual enviornment because idk why but it needs the exact version of python and mediapipe ( ts actually pmo 🙏😭)
