# -ai-hand-sign-decetor
idk man i just did it as a late night project

you need to put the file into a folder then open command prompt in the folder's location and then paste this :








**
# py -3.10 -m venv handenv
# handenv\Scripts\activate
# pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy
# python ai_hand_control_final.py
**


it will create a virtual enviornment because idk why but it needs the exact version of python and mediapipe ( ts actually pmo 🙏😭)
